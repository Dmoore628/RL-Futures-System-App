2. **Broker Wheel Tooltip**: Removed "Drag to rotate • Hover to explore" tooltip
3. **Back to Welcome Button**: Fixed redirect functionality and updated styling

## Environment Verification

### Development Environment
- **Docker Compose**: `docker-compose.dev.yml`
- **Dockerfile**: `frontend/Dockerfile.dev`
- **Port**: 3000
- **Features**: Hot reloading, volume mounts, live code changes

### Production Environment
- **Docker Compose**: `docker-compose.yml`
- **Dockerfile**: `frontend/Dockerfile`
- **Port**: 3000 (mapped to nginx port 80)
- **Features**: Optimized build, nginx serving, security headers

## Verification Scripts

### 1. Consistency Verification
```bash
./verify-consistency.sh
```
This script verifies:
- All modified files are present
- UI changes are properly implemented
- Component imports are correct
- Styling changes are applied

### 2. Development Update
```bash
npm run update-dev
```
Updates and restarts the development environment with all changes.

### 3. Production Update
```bash
npm run update-prod
```
Builds and tests the production environment with all changes.

## Build Verification

The production build now includes verification steps that check:
- ✅ BrokerLogosBanner component is included
- ✅ BrokerWheel3D component is included
- ✅ ConfigurationForm component is included
- ✅ UI styling changes are present
- ✅ Navigation changes are included

## Docker Configuration Sync

The `sync-docker-configs.js` script automatically:
- Syncs Docker configurations between environments
- Updates production build settings
- Ensures component inclusion in builds
- Creates verification scripts

## Testing Checklist

### Development Testing
1. Start development: `npm run update-dev`
2. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/welcome
3. Verify broker logos have white backgrounds
4. Verify 3D wheel has no tooltip
5. Test navigation to upload page
6. Verify back button works and is styled correctly

### Production Testing
1. Build production: `npm run update-prod`
2. Test production build: `docker run --rm -p 8080:80 rl-futures-frontend:latest`
3. Navigate to: http://localhost:8080/welcome
4. Verify all UI changes work identically to development
